#If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

minutes_per_mile = (43.5 * 1.61) / 10 #minutes per mile
miles_per_hour = ((10 * 60) / (43.5 * 1.61 )) #miles per hour
